- 👋 Hi, Saurabh here ...
- 👀 I am a Flutter developer ...
- 🌱 I’m currently developing a crossplatform flutter app 'De-crypt'. Users of this app will have access to detailed technical data of financial markets that will help them identify optimal entry      and exit positions to trade in those markets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on promising flutter and dart projects.
- 📫 Contact me at srbsrm2@gmail.com ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm trekking in mountains 😄 ...
